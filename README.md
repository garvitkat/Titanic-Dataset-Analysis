## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Titanic Dataset to better understand:

1. How was evacuation prioritized when ship was sinking?
2. Were the rich given priority while assigning lifeboats?
3. Were women and evacuated first?
4. How did family size impact the chance of survival?
5. How important were boarding point and cabin location?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three files available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

At the end of the notebook, there is necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict whether person will survive or not.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@garvitkataria/would-you-have-survived-on-sinking-titanic-e534d4acef33).
